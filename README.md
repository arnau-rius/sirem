# Sirem: A Simulation Framework for Understanding the Effects of Recommender Systems in Online Music Environments


A simulation framework for the visualization and analysis of the effects of different recommenders systems in an online music environment. This simulation draws mainly on the e-commerce simulation work of Fleder and Hosanagar. However, SIREM also accounts for the specificities of news consumption, such as evolving users preferences and editorial priming (promoted articles on a news website).

SIREN's interface currently offers recommendations based the [MyMediaLite](www.mymedialite.net/) toolbox and visualizations for two diversity metrics (long-tail and unexpectedness). SIREN can be used by content providers (news outlets) to investigate which recommendation strategy fits better their diversity needs. At the same time, SIREN's code can be adapted/expanded by researchers to analyse various recommender effects in a news environment.
